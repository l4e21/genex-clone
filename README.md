# Genetic Programming Framework

**Workthrough of 'Genetic Algorithms in Elixir'**

Many examples in the book were outdated or improper. Official repo is too complex for the scope of my uses.


Options for running:

:population_size

:selection_type

:selection_rate

:crossover_type

:mutation_type

:mutation_rate

:reinsertion_strategy

See examples in scripts

***TODO***

Multi-population handling
Improved naming + refactoring (I don't like how the book does it)
